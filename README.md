TotalVirus API Scanner

*Disclaimer:* I am not an experienced programmer; there are more than likely a LOT of errors in this program.

This is a simple program that scans a folder on your computer and compares the SHA-256 hash of a file to the VirusTotal database; you will need your own VirusTotal API key to operate this program correctly.
