TotalVirus API Scanner

*Disclaimer:* I am not an experianced programmer, there is more than likly a LOT of errors in this program.

This is a simple program that scans folder on your computer and compaires the SHA-256 hash of a file to the VirusTotal database, you will need your own VirusTotal API key to operate this program correctly.
